# About me
I'm Odysseus, a middle school student in Greece. My goal is to become a full-stack developer. I'm learning Python, HTML, CSS, and more to come.

# About this repo
This is a library with all of the HTML and CSS projects I have created. Currently, there's just Python but I will upload my HTML page, and anything else when it's completed.

# Bugs
I usually fix bugs on my own but if you find one, post an issue and I will look into it. If you have the time, feel free to fix it as well!
