# About me
I'm Odysseus, a middle school student in Greece. My goal is to become a full-stack developer. I'm learning Python, HTML, CSS, C++, and more to come.

# About this repo
This is a my website repo. I will try and upgrade it as I expand my knowledge.

# Bugs
I usually fix bugs on my own but if you find one, post an issue and I will look into it. If you have the time, feel free to fix it as well!
